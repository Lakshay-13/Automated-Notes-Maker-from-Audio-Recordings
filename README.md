“Voice is the basic, common, and efficient form of a communication method for people to interact with each other.”

Today speech technologies are commonly available for a limited but interesting range of tasks. These technologies enable machines to respond correctly and reliably to human voices and provide useful and valuable services. As communicating with a computer is faster using voice rather than using a keyboard, people will prefer such a system.

Communication among human beings is dominated by spoken language, therefore it is natural for people to expect voice interfaces with computers. This can be accomplished by developing a voice recognition system - speech-to-text which allows the computer to translate voice requests and dictation into text. Voice recognition system - speech-to-text is the process of converting an acoustic signal which is captured using a microphone to a set of words. The recorded data can be used for document preparation.

In this project we aim to develop a computer program based on Deep Learning Neural Networks to make the computer understand speech commands and convert it into text.
